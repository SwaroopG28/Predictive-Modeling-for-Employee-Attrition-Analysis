# Predictive-Modeling-for-Employee-Attrition-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes employee data to predict **attrition** using machine learning techniques. By identifying key factors influencing attrition, the model provides insights that can help organizations improve retention strategies.

## Key Features
- Conducts **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends and patterns related to employee attrition.
- Implements **feature engineering** to optimize predictive variables.
- Trains multiple machine learning models to predict attrition, with evaluation metrics like **accuracy** and **ROC-AUC**.
- Provides insights into important features affecting employee retention and attrition.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for data analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation.
- **Scikit-Learn** for model building and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization.

## Objective
The primary objective is to predict employee attrition accurately and analyze the factors contributing to turnover, enabling data-driven retention strategies.
